# InfluxDB [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/influxdb/influxdb/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/influxdb/influxdb/tree/master)

## An Open-Source, Distributed, Time Series Database

> InfluxDB v0.9.0 is now in the alpha phase. Builds are currently tagged as RCs, but they're alpha stage at this point. We will update this document when the first stable RC is ready. However, the current builds have an API that should not change significantly between now and the final 0.9.0 release. Most of the work we're doing now is focused on features and stability for clustering. So please develop against the current 0.9.0 RCs for new projects that won't go into production for a little bit.

InfluxDB is an open source **distributed time series database** with
**no external dependencies**. It's useful for recording metrics,
events, and performing analytics.

## Features

* Built-in [HTTP API] (http://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/reading_and_writing_data.html) so you don't have to write any server side code to get up and running.
* Clustering is supported out of the box, so that you can scale horizontally to handle your data.
* Simple to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out.
* It aims to answer queries in real-time. That means every data point is
  indexed as it comes in and is immediately available in queries that
  should return in < 100ms.

## Getting Started
*The following directions apply only to the 0.9.0 release or building from the source on master.*

### Building

You don't need to build the project to use it - you can use any of our
[pre-built packages](http://influxdb.com/download/) to install InfluxDB. That's
the recommended way to get it running. However, if you want to contribute to the core of InfluxDB, you'll need to build.
For those adventurous enough, you can
[follow along on our docs](http://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Starting InfluxDB
* `service influxdb start` if you have installed InfluxDB using an official Debian or RPM package.
* `$GOPATH/bin/influxd` if you have built InfluxDB from source.

### Creating your first database

```JSON
curl -G 'http://localhost:8086/query' --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE mydb"
```

### Insert some data
```JSON
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8086/write -d '
{
    "database": "mydb",
    "retentionPolicy": "default",
    "points": [
        {
            "time": "2014-11-10T23:00:00Z",
            "measurement": "cpu",
             "tags": {
                 "region":"uswest",
                 "host": "server01"
            },
             "fields":{
                 "value": 100
            }
         }
      ]
}'
```
### Query for the data
```JSON
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query?pretty=true \
--data-urlencode "db=mydb" --data-urlencode "q=SELECT * FROM cpu"
```
